# Project Overview: shotgun-cli

This document provides a high-level overview of the `shotgun-cli` Go project, its architecture, and core principles.

## Architecture: Clean/Hexagonal

The project follows a Clean Architecture pattern, separating concerns into distinct layers. When adding new features, respect these boundaries.

1.  **`cmd` (Presentation/Adapter Layer)**
    *   **Purpose**: Handles user interaction via CLI commands using the Cobra framework. This is the application's composition root.
    *   **Responsibilities**: Parsing flags, orchestrating calls to core services, and handling top-level errors.
    *   **Example**: `@cmd/send.go` defines the `context send` command.

2.  **`internal/ui` (Presentation/Adapter Layer)**
    *   **Purpose**: Implements the interactive TUI wizard using the Bubble Tea framework.
    *   **Pattern**: Follows the Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern. State is managed in models, views render the UI, and updates are handled via messages.
    *   **Example**: `@internal/ui/wizard.go` is the main orchestrator for the TUI.

3.  **`internal/core` (Core/Domain Layer)**
    *   **Purpose**: Contains the core business logic, independent of external frameworks and tools.
    *   **Sub-packages**:
        *   `context`: Builds the final LLM context.
        *   `scanner`: Scans the filesystem.
        *   `template`: Manages prompt templates.
        *   `ignore`: Handles file ignore logic.
        *   `tokens`: Estimates token counts.
    *   **Rule**: Code in this layer should NOT depend on `cmd`, `ui`, or `platform`.

4.  **`internal/platform` (Infrastructure Layer)**
    *   **Purpose**: Implements integrations with external systems.
    *   **Sub-packages**:
        *   `gemini`: Interacts with the Google Gemini AI via an external binary.
        *   `clipboard`: Provides cross-platform clipboard access.

## Key Frameworks

*   **CLI**: `github.com/spf13/cobra`
*   **Configuration**: `github.com/spf13/viper`
*   **TUI**: `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea`
*   **Logging**: `github.com/rs/zerolog`

## Dependency Injection

The project uses manual dependency injection. The `cmd` package acts as the **composition root**, where services from `core` and `platform` are instantiated and wired together. Avoid creating global instances; pass dependencies explicitly.
